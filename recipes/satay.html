        Though Satay Chicken is better known as Thai or Malaysian food, it
        actually originated from Indonesia and the Indonesian version is by far
        the simplest. The Peanut Sauce is my own - refer to the notes for why I
        prefer this to the authentic version. It is thick so it is great for
        dolloping, rather than a thin dipping sauce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Satay Chicken is fabulous for outdoor BBQ's, parties and for fast
        midweek meals! They also reheat really well in the microwave. They can
        be cooked on the outdoor grill, on the stove or under the grill/broiler.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <h4>Chicken</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 lb / 500g chicken thigh fillets</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tbsp sweet soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>12 - 14 small bamboo skewers</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Peanut Sauce</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 small or 1/2 large onion</li>
        <li>3 birds eye chillis</li>
        <li>1/2 cup peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tbsp kecap manis</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup crushed unsalted roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>1 - 2 tbsp fresh lime juice</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <h4>Chicken</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cut the chicken into 1.5cm/0.5" cubes. Thread onto skewers - 4 to 5
          pieces per skewer.
        </li>
        <li>Combine kecap manis and butter, then brush onto chicken.</li>
        <li>
          Cook the skewers on a hot BBQ (outdoor grill) or on the stove in a
          large non stick fry pan (add a splash of oil, and make sure the
          skewers will fit in the pan). Grill/broiler would also work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve, garnished with crushed peanuts, shallots and with lime wedges
          and Peanut Sauce on the side.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Peanut Sauce</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Add garlic, onion
          and chillis and cook for 3 minutes until onion is translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn heat down to medium, then add peanut butter, coconut milk, kecap
          manis, soy sauce and salt. Simmer for 10 minutes, whisking
          occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a handheld stick to puree (so the onion and chilli blends
          throughout the sauce - this is key). (See Note 2 for blending
          instructions) Stir through crushed peanuts and lime juice and simmer
          for 2 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving or to room
          temperature - it will thicken.
        </li>
      </ol>
